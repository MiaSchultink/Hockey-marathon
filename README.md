# Hockey Marathon
Hockey Marathon is a school tradition at WBAIS in which the entire highschool plays back to back hokey games for more than 12 hours. This project is a model of a website that could be used to keep track of the action and update everyone incolved. Users can see thier own and other team's games, players and scores. They can also see the schedule of the entire evnet to keep track of thier game times. Admins can create and edit teams and update game times in real time.
